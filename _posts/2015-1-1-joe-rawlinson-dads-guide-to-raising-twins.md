plan a date with your wife (be sure to schedule or it will never happen); acknowledge that this is just temporary; National Organization of Mother's of Twin Clubs (nomotc.org); feeding framework: EASY (Eat/Activity/Sleep/Your personal time); hands free bottles; resetting expectations: "What is the worst thing that can happen if I don't do this today/this week?"; soothing babies: 5 "S" method (suck, swaddle, side/stomach, shushing, sway/singing); teach them to share using turn timer (kitchen egg timer); use positive peer pressure: a) ignore bad behavior, don't react to it b) turn to other twin and praise what she is doing, be sincere; whining: "you're not going to get what you want when you whine"; treat twins as individuals; only one lap child per row on airplanes; car seats need to be in a window seat; two separate birthday cakes; let each child select an activity on their birthday; secret: one at a time
