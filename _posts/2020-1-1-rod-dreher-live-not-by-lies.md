similarity with communism: defending rights of groups instead of individuals; Solzhenitsyn: "never knowingly support lies!"; Father Kolakovic: equip Slovak Christians & build underground church to endure communism; motto: "see (be aware); judge (what is true); act (resist evil)"; leftists: hunger for just society (without religion); modern man prefers personal pleasure over principles (including political liberties); Brave New World is more likely than 1984; man: not pilgrim but tourist in life; Moralistic Therapeutic Deism: general belief in God with happiness as ultimate purpose; great sin: stand in the way of others' pursuit of happiness; therapeutic spirit conquered churches too; changing language (Newspeak) -> control thoughts; ketman = outside adopter but inside dissenter to communism; myth of progress: present is better than the past & future will surely be better than present; humanity: grand march toward progress; opposition to Party = opposition to future = opposition to reality; classical liberals: focus on individual freedom, limited government role <-> leftists: focus on equality of outcome, heavy government role; progress can be dark without God; China: predictive software to identify future leaders & dissenters before they themselves realize; West: living in truth = transparency, no secrets <-> having a private life; young people live in an illusion: they are part of a real social network; memory: weapon of cultural self-defense; prepare family: read aloud (Lord of the Rings), movies (High Noon); imagination: can't be stolen from you; dare to be different (vaccination for kids against communism); prepare to make great sacrifices for the greater good (otherwise it might backfire at you) -> do not give in because of your children! (better education -> isolation from parents); good preparation for prison: memorizing scripture; don't take family for granted; be intentionally countercultural; focusing too much on who is an agent and who is not will tear the community apart (e.g. bringing hot tea to secret police during winter - they are people too); create & commit to small groups while you can; atomization -> demoralization -> manipulation; build bonds with Christians and people of goodwill from other religions (or no religion) too; admirers vs followers of Jesus; seeing someone act bravely makes you more courageous too; don't seek suffering but accept it when it comes; "Christianity without tears" (Huxley); "right to be unhappy" (Huxley)
