# A Gentleman at the Table

## 1. 32 Things Every Gentleman Should Know Before He Comes to the Table

1. A gentleman does not "grade" the table manners of his fellow diners.
2. A gentleman does not assume that his fellow diners are "grading" his own behavior.
3. A gentleman does not talk with his mouth full.
4. A gentleman does not chew with his mouth open, nor does he smack his lips, no matter how delicious his food may be.
5. A gentleman makes as little noise as possible while eating.
6. A gentleman does not chomp on ice.
7. A gentleman does not pick his teeth at the table.
8. A gentleman keeps his napkin in his lap while he is eating. He does not tuck it into his shirtfront.
9. A gentleman sits up straight, especially at the table.
10. A gentleman keeps his elbows off the table when a meal is under way.
11. If a gentleman finds that he has bread crumbs on his shirtfront, he brushes them off.
12. A gentleman finds no need to apologize for bread crumbs.
13. A gentleman does not play with his food, kneading his bread with his fingers or stirring the last uneaten morsels of his dinner about on his plate.
14. A gentleman does not wear his ball cap or any other headgear at the table.
15. If a gentleman is asked to pass the salt or pepper, he passes them both.
16. A gentleman does not leave the table without asking to be excused.
17. When a gentleman leaves the table, he need not explain his reason for asking to be excused.
18. A gentleman does not lean back in his chair.
19. A gentleman tries his best not to belch or burp at the table.
20. A gentleman knows that belches, burps, and coughs can occur at any time. He keeps his napkin ready to muffle unfortunate sounds.
21. A gentleman need not use his pocket-handkerchief to stifle a slight sneeze, cough, or burp at the table. Instead, he uses his napkin.
22. If a gentleman finds himself in a situation, such as a fit of sneezing, that necessitates the use of his pocket-handkerchief, he leaves the table.
23. A gentleman never blows his nose at the table.
24. A gentleman says please and thank you, especially to servers, in a restaurant or in a private home.
25. A gentleman does not wolf down his food.
26. A gentleman does not slurp his soup.
27. A gentleman does not attempt to cool his food by blowing on it. If he fears singeing his taste buds, he lets his food cool gradually and undisturbed in its own bowl or on its own plate.
28. A gentleman never argues with a server, at a restaurant or at a private party.
29. Whether he is an invited guest or the host of a restaurant party, a gentleman shows up on time.
30. A gentleman does not overstay his welcome. However, he may linger at the table after dinner, along with the other guests and his host or hostess, knowing that such moments are often the most pleasing and satisfying of the evening.
31. A gentleman does not loosen his belt, no matter how discreetly, even after an extravagantly large meal.
32. In any aspect of his life, but especially at the dinner table, a gentleman does not bite off more than he can chew.

## 2. FROM COURSE TO COURSE: Knives and Forks, and How to Use Them

1. If a gentleman discovers that his napkin has slipped from his lap to the floor, he retrieves it, if he can do so gracefully.
2. If the retrieval of his napkin threatens to disrupt the dinner table, a gentleman simply turns to his host or hostess and says, "I'm afraid I've dropped my napkin. May I have another?"
3. If a gentleman is served meat in a private home and is not offered a steak knife, he does not ask for one, lest he embarrass his host or hostess (who may not own steak knives or who may assume he has found the entrée too tough to cut with a dinner knife).
4. Once a gentleman has finished stirring his cup of coffee, his cup of tea, or his glass of iced tea, he places his spoon on his saucer. A gentleman never places a damp or soiled utensil directly on the table or the tablecloth.
5. If a server offers freshly ground pepper for a gentleman's soup, salad, or entrée, the gentleman may accept the offer or decline it, no matter what his dinner companions choose to do.
6. A gentleman does not chop up his salad with his knife and fork before proceeding to eat it. If the salad is not served in easily eaten pieces, he cuts it into one bite-sized piece at a time, as he eats it.
7. At some elegant dinner parties, a scoop of sorbet (usually citrus flavored) will be served immediately after the first course or after the entrée. A gentleman does not assume that his dessert has already arrived. He recognizes this touch of cold tartness as a "palate cleanser," intended to give his taste buds a rest either before or after a heavy entrée.
8. Unless he is confident in his knowledge of china, porcelain, and other ceramics, a gentleman refers to the plates set in from of him as "dishes." He knows it is always wiser to err on the side of simplicity than on pretentiousness.

## 3. A GENTLEMAN FACES HIS FOOD: Skillful Maneuvers at the Table

1. A gentleman never calls attention to another person's poor table manners, unless that person is his own child.
2. Unless he foresees a disaster, such as an overturned soda or a spilled bowl of soup, a gentleman does not correct the manners of even his own child while in the presence of non-family members.
3. If a gentleman is dining in a restaurant and has not been provided with the proper utensil for the food set before him, he asks his server for it immediately.
4. If a gentleman is hosting an event in his home, he provides the proper utensils for the dishes he is serving. If a gentleman does not have the proper utensils, he adjusts his menu accordingly.

8. A gentleman says please and thank you, especially to servers either in a restaurant or in a private home.

12. When he is expected to pay for his own meal in a restaurant, a gentleman is not ashamed to ask the price of any special item offered by the server.
13. Should the diners at a table close to his own become so boisterous as to imperil the pleasure of the gentleman's own dinner companions, he does not attempt to chasten them. Instead, he leaves his table to seek the assistance of the maître d', the host, or the hostess.

## 6. THE JOB OF EATING: Business Meals, All Day Long

1. If a gentleman intends to do business in a restaurant, he always makes a reservation.
2. A gentleman shows up on time for a business luncheon. He realizes that being late is not only bad for business—it is also rude behavior.
3. If his employer has established a limit on a gentleman's entertainment budget, he sticks to it.
4. Even if a gentleman's employer has given him the go-ahead to splurge, a gentleman does not abuse his boss's generosity. He can "splurge" without ordering the biggest steak on the menu or the rarest bottle of wine in the cellar.
5. When a gentleman is being entertained at a business luncheon or dinner, he waits for his host or hostess to take the lead before ordering the most expensive entrée or the most extravagant bottle of wine on the menu.
6. If a gentleman's company does not have a budget for elaborate entertaining, the gentleman chooses a restaurant where he is confident the prices will not send the company into bankruptcy.
7. When selecting a restaurant for a business luncheon or dinner, especially if he is not well acquainted with his clients and their taste in food, he makes his reservation at an establishment with a varied, mainstream menu.
8. If a gentleman intends to conduct formal business during a meal-and particularly if he requires flip charts or PowerPoint presentations—he requests a private dining room.
9. A gentleman knows that it is his own behavior and his own professionalism-not the extravagance of the restaurant—that will impress his clients and make his company shine.
10. A gentleman does not overindulge simply because he is a guest, being entertained on another persons expense account. A gentleman never overindulges.

### A GENTLEMAN ON A JOB INTERVIEW

- A gentleman waits to follow the lead of his host, or others at the table, before he orders either food or drink.
- To prevent unsightliness in the midst of the interview process, a gentleman avoids ordering potentially sloppy dishes such as pasta-unless he is fully confident he can handle them without mishap.
- If the direction of the conversation seems to stray from the business at hand, the gentleman may attempt to redirect it by saying, "Multi-Net did awfully well last year, didn't it?"
- If his host suggests a restaurant where the gentleman cannot, may not, or wishes not to eat the food, he lets that fact be known as soon as possible. More often than not, however, he will not even be asked about his preferences before the location for a job-interview meal is established. In such cases, he does his best to find something on the menu he can eat.
- If the table conversation turns to topics that the gentleman finds unpleasant—or if jokes of a racist, ethnic, homophobic, or any other degrading nature crop up—he does not join in the conversation or pretend to find the jokes amusing. To preserve his own self-respect, he may choose to speak up, stating that he finds such comments offensive. Even if he chooses to remain silent, he will have learned an important lesson about the business where he may be asked to work. Such comments may, in fact, be a determining factor in his decision to accept or turn down the job offer.
- If a gentleman does not drink alcohol, he does not order alcohol, even if everybody else at the table is ordering it.
- On an interview, a gentleman is always well advised to monitor his alcohol intake. Even if his interviewers are in their cups, they will have second thoughts about an interviewee who must be folded into a taxi at the end of the evening.

## 7. STAND UP AND BE FED: Cocktail Parties and Buffet Suppers

1. At a cocktail supper, or any occasion where hors d'oeuvres and canapés have been set out for the guests, a gentleman does not sort through the snacks in search of the most luscious or largest morsel. Neither does he pick out all the cashews from the mixed nuts.
2. If a gentleman is hosting a cocktail party, he invites only as many people as can comfortably enjoy themselves in his home.
3. If a gentleman is hosting a cocktail party where he provides alcohol, he must also provide food.
4. When hosting any event where alcohol is provided, a gentleman always provides nonalcoholic options.
5. A gentleman does not attend a party to which he has not been specifically invited-unless he is assured that the host has insisted that all his friends "bring anybody" they know.
6. At a buffet dinner, once a gentleman has filled his plate to an appropriate level, he need not wait for all the other guests to wend their way through the line before he begins eating. In such situations, however, he waits until at least a couple of other guests have filled their plates and joined him. He does not dine alone.
7. Even if he is not well acquainted with anyone else in the room, once he has filled his plate, a gentleman seats himself near another guest, or a group of guests, and attempts to begin a conversation, either by introducing himself or by saying, "My, isn't this pork roast beautiful?"
8. A gentleman does not station himself by the food table at a cocktail party, feeding himself off the serving platters.
9. A gentleman never places his glass or his coffee cup directly on a piece of furniture, even if that piece of furniture is a glass-top coffee table. He knows that a sweaty glass will leave damp rings even on glass or stone, while the heat from hot coffee will leave circles of steam on any surface.
10. If a gentleman is offered a coaster or a cocktail napkin, he uses it.
11. If a gentleman is not offered a coaster or a cocktail napkin, he asks for one.

## 8. THE GHASTLY TABLE: Dealing with Dining Disasters

1. **Removing stuck food from teeth**: use fork or spoon if possible, use fingers otherwise, mask your action with a napkin; dispose item on plate
2. **Spilling soup or sauce on clothes**: excuse yourself from the table without explanation; assess damage in bathroom; remove / lessen stain from shirt or trousers using napkin dampened with water; be more careful with ties; use warm water if stain is oil based, use cold water if not; ask help from attendant in men's room (do not complain if he make it worse); give tip afterwards; if you notice stain on someone else, advise him quietly ("Gerry, I believe you've got a bit of sauce there on your shirt."); same applies to a friend whose fly has been left unzipped.
3. **Problem with bill in a restaurant**: ok to review the bill before paying; call server discreetly if any error; if server argues call for manager.
4. **Credit card declined in restaurant**: don't lose temper; ask if you can pay by check, visit the nearest ATM or return the next day with cash; if no other option, ask help from friends; repay within 24 hours.
5. **Food dropped on tablecloth or floor**: do not call attention; use napkin to pick up food or blot up sauce; ask for new napkin; do not give further explanation.
6. **Audible burp at the table**: simply say "Excuse me, please"; only forgiven once per meal; go to bathroom if needed for sip of water or ask host for soda water; final solution: inform host that you must leave immediately.
7. **Knocking over glass of drink**: if not broken, use napkin to sop up mess; apply cold water for red wine stain; you can do nothing except say "Excuse me for making such a mess."; when writing to thank-you note, remember to say, "I hope you'll forgive my clumsiness with the wine glass."; otherwise, say nothing more.
8. **Inedible food in restaurant**: make no apology for telling the server, "I'd like my steak cooked medium, not medium rare, please," or "My chicken is overcooked—would you ask the chef please?"; if problem not solved, ask for manager; as a patron of the restaurant, you have a right to ask for his food to be served the way you want it; otherwise avoid restaurant in the future.
9. **Misbehaving children**: do not attempt to discipline child in public; instead, take child away from the table, exercise appropriate discipline in private place; if child doesn't change behavior, ask for to-go boxes for the food of all family members & leave as quickly / discreetly as possible.
10. **Argument at dinner table**: simply say, "Now, friends, let's change the subject."; if you are the host at a bigger table, rise from seat if needed; if guests refuse to behave themselves, ask them to change seats; if alcohol is problem ask them to abstain from further drinking; worst case you may be forced to say, "Tom and Tammy, I'm afraid this is getting out of hand. I must ask you either to end this conversation, or take it to the sidewalk."; if problem continues, don't take sides but ask both arguing partner to leave.
11. **Steak dropped beside grill**: nobody needs know what happens in the privacy of your own kitchen; if cooking in the presence of his guests, however, you must express at least some concern over a steak that has slipped off the spatula and onto the gravel; if replacement steak is available, say, "I'm afraid this one is headed to the garbage."; if not, suggest that you and another guest (preferably your date or a very close friend) share one of the larger steaks; you may be ok with washing it off & grilling it for yourself but some of your guests may find this solution unacceptable.
12. **Dirty utensils**: in restaurant, simply ask server for replacements: "I don't think this spoon is quite clean. May I have another?"; in private home, call as little attention as possible; do not inspect flatware right after taking your place at the table; instead when food is served, simply ask your host, "Otto, could I have a fresh salad fork?"; you can create excuse for requesting replacement by deliberately dropping the dirty utensil on the floor.
13. **Can't eat food**: if you have food allergies inform host at invitation; if food is served, you can leave it untouched or eat bit of bread; when host asks reply truthfully and simply: "This looks lovely but I can't eat shellfish"; if there are religious reasons, say "Thanks but I don't eat shellfish"; don't say "Sorry, but I don't eat shellfish", no need to apologize for your beliefs.
14. **Illness**: leave table immediately; head for bathroom; if no better tell host you must leave immediately; if throw up at the table, don't need to feel personal guilt (unless it's caused by overeating); assist host to clean up the table if you feel well enough, depart asap if you don't; do not avoid reality when writing thank-you note, state frankly: "Your dinner party was lovely. I hope my illness did not ruin the evening for you and your other guests."; send flowers if appropriate.
15. **Food poisoning**: if private dinner party or cooked by host, nothing to do; you can mention to other guests to find out if it was your stomach or the food but nothing is accomplished by calling his host or hostess and saying, "Last night was great, but I ended up spending six hours in the emergency room."; however, if food provided by a caterer, let host know about the problem.
16. **Choking**: act immediately; apply Heimlich if you know how to; if not, do not risk further damage; call for assistance loudly and firmly: "Does anybody here know the Heimlich?" (ok to shout if needed); if no response, call 911 for immediate assistance; do not assume you can drive him to emergency room in your own car; consult with local chapter of Americal Red Cross for training in the Heimlich maneuver (don't assume you know it just because you see a step-by-step chart in a restroom).
