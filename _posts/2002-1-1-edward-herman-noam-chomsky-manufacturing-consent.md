propaganda model: media serve elites who finance them; virtual communities organized to buy and sell goods and are at odds with physical communities; worthy vs unworthy victims (victims of enemy vs client states) - eg one Polish priest killed in 1984 by Communists vs 100 religious victims of US client states; genocide: frequently used for enemy states, but not in client states - eg Turkey "represses" but Iraq engages in "genocide"; legitimating vs meaningless third world elections - eg elections in El Salvador in 1980s "step towards democracy" vs Nicaraguan election is "sham" despite more favorable democratic conditions; demonize Soviet Union - eg Pope shot by KGB agent in 1981 despite evidence; Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia: US is victim not aggressor despite forced minority government rejected by locals (Vietnam), chemical warfare and bombings; worthy victims of Pol Pot (Cambodia) vs unworthy victims of Suharto (Indonesia) whe during genocide in East Timor; "manufacture of consent" (Walter Lippmann); ingredients of propaganda model: 1) size & concentrated ownership of mass media firms 2) advertising as primary income source 3) reliance on government, business and "experts" for information 4) desciplining media through "flaks" (negative responses) 5) anticommunism
